# JavaScript-Garage-Sale-Website
Developed a web application for a garage sale fund raiser. The organizers want an online garage sale application where the users can fill an online form  and be given a receipt.
The following user inputs must be validated:
• 2 Mandatory fields name and email address.
• Fields with specific format 
• Credit Card in format xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx 
eg: 4111-1111-1111-1111
• Credit Card Expiry Month in format: MMM
eg: NOV
• Credit Card Expiry Year in format: yyyy
eg: 2021
• At least one item should be bought and the value customer enters in the item quantity input boxes should be a number. Do not use input type number in HTML. 
You must do the validation in JavaScript. 
As a part of the fund raiser the customer must donate $10 or 10% of the total 
price of items they are buying, whichever is higher. Automatically calculate the donation amount based on the total purchase. 
If any errors exist, display all the error messages on the web page. Do not use a JavaScript popup box for this purpose or show only one error at a time. 
Generate a receipt to give to the customer. Show only the last 4 digits of the 
credit card along with the rest of the information like name, email, products, quantity, total cost, donation amount, etc.
